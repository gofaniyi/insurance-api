## Create Risk Types

* A risk type is an object that holds the definite description and attributes of a risk. 
* You can select different field names, types and also specify if a field is required or not.
* For fields like radio buttons or dropdown, you can specify the options/choices using a comma separated string
* You can also choose to remove a custom attribute from the setup
* Duplicate attributes are validated and also duplicate risk type name/title
